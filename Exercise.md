1.	Write a program to input 2 integers (the first number is smaller than the second number). Print the numbers from the first number to the second number, but replace numbers divisible by 3 with 'F', divisible by 5 with 'Z', and divisible by both 3 and 5 with 'A'.
2.	Write a program to input an array of integers and print the array in reverse order.
3.	Write a program to input 2 integers (the first number is smaller than the second number). Count the number of even and odd elements in the range from the first number to the second number.
4.	Write a program to find the number of elements greater than a given value in an array of integers.
5.	Write a program to input an array (array size and array elements). Print the most frequent element in the array of integers.
6.	Write a program to input an array (array size and array elements). Print the number of unique elements in the array of integers (elements that do not repeat).
